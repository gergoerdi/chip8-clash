CHIP-8 implemented in CλaSH
===========================

For RetroChallenge 2018/09. Progress is to be documented at
https://gergo.erdi.hu/blog/tags/retrochallenge/

It uses my hodge-podge library of random CλaSH functions, which I've
uploaded separately to https://github.com/gergoerdi/clash-sandbox

The target platform is Papilio Pro with the LogicStart mega-wing:
